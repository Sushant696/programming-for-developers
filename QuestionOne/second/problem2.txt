You have two sorted arrays of investment returns, returns1 and returns2, and a target number k. You
want to find the kth lowest combined return that can be achieved by selecting one investment from each
array.

Rules:
The arrays are sorted in ascending order.
You can access any element in the arrays.

Goal:
Determine the kth lowest combined return that can be achieved.
Input:
returns1: The first sorted array of investment returns.
returns2: The second sorted array of investment returns.
k: The target index of the lowest combined return.

Output:
The kth lowest combined return that can be achieved.
Example 1:
Input: returns1= [2,5], returns2= [3,4], k = 2

Output: 8
Explanation: The 2 smallest investments are are:
- returns1 [0] * returns2 [0] = 2 * 3 = 6
- returns1 [0] * returns2 [1] = 2 * 4 = 8
The 2nd smallest investment is 8.

Example 2:
Input: returns1= [-4,-2,0,3], returns2= [2,4], k = 6

Output: 0
Explanation: The 6 smallest products are:
- returns1 [0] * returns2 [1] = (-4) * 4 = -16
- returns1 [0] * returns2 [0] = (-4) * 2 = -8
- returns1 [1] * returns2 [1] = (-2) * 4 = -8
- returns1 [1] * returns2 [0] = (-2) * 2 = -4
- returns1 [2] * returns2 [0] = 0 * 2 = 0
- returns1 [2] * returns2 [1] = 0 * 4 = 0
The 6th smallest investment is 0.
