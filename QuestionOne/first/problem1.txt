You have a material with n temperature levels. You know that there exists a critical temperature f where
0 <= f <= n such that the material will react or change its properties at temperatures higher than f but
remain unchanged at or below f.

Rules:
You can measure the material's properties at any temperature level once.
If the material reacts or changes its properties, you can no longer use it for further measurements.
If the material remains unchanged, you can reuse it for further measurements.

Goal:
Determine the minimum number of measurements required to find the critical temperature.

Input:
k: The number of identical samples of the material.
n: The number of temperature levels.

Output:
The minimum number of measurements required to find the critical temperature.

Example 1:
Input: k = 1, n = 2

Output: 2
Explanation:
Check the material at temperature 1. If its property changes, we know that f = 0.
Otherwise, raise temperature to 2 and check if property changes. If its property changes, 
we know that f =1.
If its property changes at temperature, then we know f = 2.

Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
Example 2:
Input: k = 2, n = 6
Output: 3
Example 3:
Input: k = 3, n = 14
Output: 4
